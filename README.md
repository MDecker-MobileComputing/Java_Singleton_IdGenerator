# Example for Design Pattern "Singleton" in Java #

<br>

This repository contains an Eclipse project for a Java program that demonstrates the design pattern  
[Singleton](https://www.ionos.de/digitalguide/websites/web-entwicklung/was-ist-das-singleton-pattern/).

With this design pattern, it can be ensured that there is at most one object of a particular class.

The example is class `IdGenerator` for providing unique IDs (e.g., for numbering message). 
To provide unique IDs there must not be more than one instance of this class.
